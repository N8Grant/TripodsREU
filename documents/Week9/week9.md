- Use the barchart for immune vizualization for each expression group then order within expression group based on tumor radius and age of diagnosis
- look at intersections of gene expression clusters and immune clusters

## Done
## To Do
- Do what the postdoc tole me to do 
- finish prediction stuff
- use SVR with inputs of B2M, HLA-Family and CD74 to try to predict CD8 T cells
    - try using linear kernel, if it works well or comparable to RBF kernel tehn use that and state weights assigned with it  
- Genes with DNA Repair, Stem Cell, apoptosis/cell death, inflammatory pathway, or epithelial mesenchymal transitionstem cell
- Stacked bar chart for mortality rates
- use mortality rate instead of living status
- Video!!!!!
- report correlation for bap1 -1 age vs dss time
- add lines for correaltion and text on lines for correlation coeffience and p value for the scatterplots which show correlation
- Visualize the mortality rate differences
- keep naming consistent, use immune naming for immune clustering graphs
- Start by showing immune cell fractions for immune cell clusters
- add plot for tumor radius of expression groups
- add one more column for statistical test used and if all the same state test
- Write bap1 wild type or bap1 mutated instead of 0 and -1
