## Goals
- Reformat paper
- Make paper in order of 
    - state phenotype differences
    - Then show the immune graphs but make the mimmune cells color coded so it all matches up
    - Then make another section for the differences in Cd8 T cells between groups
        - Take the chart that I already have for immune cell differences and include the two bap 1 groups means and standard deviations
    - Make a new section for the correlation of CD8 T cells and certain genes
    - Make a new section for mortality rate
    - Make plots for CD8 t cells vs DSS_time scatter plot
    - For both BAP1 0 and BAP1 -1 patients
        - Age of Diagnosis vs survival time with color being CD8 T cells high or CD8 T cells low
        - Boxplot for cd8 t cell high  and cd8 t cell low vs survival months and age of diagnosis
- Make a synopsis of my findings for the doctor
