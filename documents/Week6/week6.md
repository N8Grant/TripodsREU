## Goals 
- START RESULTS SECTION
- use Minmax patient wise
- use postdocs data to see if there are any differences between gene expressions
- Make a plot of the differences and where the highest curvature is
- Look at BAP1 expression levels and see if there is any correlation
- Do mw tests on seperate groups to see if there are differences 

## Redoing Work from last week with Patient wise normalization
The ratios of BAP1 patients hasnt changed much between clustering as there is one group made up entirley oout of BAP1 -1 patients, expression group 2. After doing the analysis patient wise I came up with different genes which contribute to the patients.

The place where i found apol6 is now showing crazy high correlations for the HLA family of genes, and also with CD74.. Interesting because in the previous analysis both HLA and CD74 showed up. B2M also shows up here.

## Work on Paper

All of my results are written out definitley going to nmeed some revision because I feel like my language isnt as acientific as it should be.

## PostDoc Anslysis
