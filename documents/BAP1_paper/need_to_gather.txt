Graphs and data that I need for the paper:

Vizualizations for BAP1 -1 and BAP1 0 groups in terms of immune cell concentrations. 
Probably would be better to make a graph which compares groups side by side so that comparision is easier.

Graphs for stat significant immune fraction differences between groups
B cell
CD8T
Monocytes
DC

Difference between tumor basal diameter between two groups and p value

Differences between disease specific survival between the two groups

Similarity between data for BAP1 and PTPN23 groups.

Gotta look up more information about how pathways work and if that is a possible reason this isnt showing 
up along GSEA results.

A table of phenotype breakdown as shown in figure Table 1 in the sample paper.
