# Week 5
## Goals 
- Email cBioPortal to see how they got the numbers they did for the UVM trials from usc xena raw data, but first see if they codes they have for conversion work for determining how they got the data

- Cluster patients based off of immune cell frequency
- Also do immune cell clustering for the subgropus of BAP1 0 and BAP1 1 groups
- See if the diameter varies based off of the groups of the clusters for immune cluster

- Look at RGS5 to find the methods for making many of the graphs
- Make simmilar graphs to the on which the other student has
- Just use a scientific reports template for the paper and start to gather resources and start on that 
- Make a plot simmilar to plot J in figure 1 of the students paper

Done:
- When doing this analysis do PCA reduction and see if the first 10 PCA components have a high correlation with any of the top 10 most variant genes
- Instead of finding high entropy genes, instead find the genes that are most varient across each cluster and determine those to be of possible interest
- See if there is a correlation between BAP1 0 or BAP1 -1 gene expresison levels to immune cell fractions
- See if there is a correlation between the tumor diameter and immune cell concetration both over all of the patients and also within the BAP1 0 and BAP1 -1 groups
- See if the diameter varies based off of the groups of the clusters
- When finding other genes from subgroups do manwhittney test on most variant genes between the two groups and see if MW test yields significant difference between the two gene expression levels
